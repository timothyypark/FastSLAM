SLAM (Simultaneous Lcalizaiton and Mapping) is an algorithm used for Computer vision. It allows a robot to pinpoint its own location, as well as map the landmarks that make up its surroundings. A full descriptions of functions and classes can be found in SLAM.md. Running utils.py will run a simulation of FastSLAM.
